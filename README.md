# Data Science Case Study: Predicting Salaries of Indeed Job Postings 

### Predicting Salaries of Job Applications for Job Search Engine Indeed using Machine Learning with Python Implementation

**Why** In this case study we aim to create salary estimate feature for job search engine. This estimated salaries for new job postings can improve the job seekers experience by providing them salary information.

**How** We will use range of Machine Learning Models (Lasso Regression, Random Forest, GBM, XGBoost) to estimate the salaries for given job postings and compare to select the best performing model. Keep in mind that we don't have true salaries to evaluate the model in usual way.
